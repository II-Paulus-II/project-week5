# Workflow Notes

## Client side

Need level counter on client side - Global let levelCounter = { level: 1 } starts at 1
Need to send the level in both requests [Upgrade perhaps with usernames can save progress so no need for that later - unless player wants to repeat a level maybe]

## Server side
